# General notes

## Durge Honor mode - Save Alfira

1. Start a game as usual creating your Dark Urge character
2. After Finishing the Tutorial gather your allies as in Shadowheart, Aastarion, Gale and Leazel (and Wyll+Karlach at Step 8)
3. (Optional) Reset Leazel at Withers and give her "Great Weapon Fighting" at Level 1 (just like Step 2 this will increase your chances)
4. Farm for EXP in the Ruins before entering the Grove. (You likely did it already a couple of times so I won´t give tips for that here on how to do it optimally)
5. Do your FIRST Long Rest just before the grove battle. This one is safe and Alfira will not appear.
6. From now on it becomes risky to Long Rest since depending on how much Story you progress, what other Events are in the Queue and of course how many LR you make, Alfira appearing becomes more and more likely. So make Combat as carefully planned out as you can.
7. After Finishing the fight at "the bloody gate" your mission is to just get Exp to make it somehow to level 3 before the next long rest.
8. At Level 3 two important things happen: 1. Gale will be able to upcast Level 1 "Sleep" to Level 2 which Targets 36 HP (Alfira has 26) and 2. Leazel gets to pick a Subclass; here you pick Battlemaster and choose a Manoeuvre that gives you a "Superiority Die" like "Feinting Attack" for an extra 1d8 damage die.
9. Now we have all we need: Go to Alfira (I always talk to her before knocking her out but it´s not necessary if you don´t want to); activate non-Lethal-Attacks in you Hotbar under Passives; Activate Turn Based mode; Use Gale to Cast Level 2 Sleep on Alfira; Attack her with Leazel using Feinting Attack; and this should be all (for now)(You do 1d4+2d6+1d8+4 Crit= 16~56 Damage)
10. This should knock her out in 1 attack and not trigger any aggression from her or anybody else.
11. Go cross the bridge to the blighted village and long rest on the pile of adventurer corpses
12. The Scene might not trigger immediately so repeat Step 10 every Day DIRECTLY AFTER THE LONG REST until it appears. We are all sometimes forgetful and waste our Sup. Dice or Spell Slots during the day so just do it at the BEGINNING of the day to not forget it and having wasted a couple hours for nothing.
13. As said by comments one way to trigger it is by crossing the bridge to the blighted village

## Sorcerous vault

### Karsus Door: The Annals of Karsus

For this section of our Baldur's Gate 3 Sorcerous Sundries Vault guide, we look at how we can acquire the Annals of Karsus. This book is required to progress Gale's Wizard of Waterdeep quest. To obtain it, enter the Silverhand room, and go through the following doorways:

    Silverhand room
    Abjuration - This takes you to the next chamber.
    Silver - There's a corridor here that leads to a lever. Interact with it to unlock the Karsus door.
    Wild - Leave via this doorway to return to the main area.

### Elminster Door: The Tharchiate Codex

We're not done yet since there's still another room. Back at the main area, pass through the Silverhand door. Then, go through the following:

    Silverhand room
    Evocation - This takes you to the next chamber.
    Wish - This has a corridor and a lever that unlocks the Elminster door.
    Foresight - This brings you back to the main chamber.
