I perfected this build while ago but never make video or post about it. Here's what I did:

Wood Elf race for more movement. Only 2 level in Monk for Step of Wind Dash. 4 level to Elk Heart Barbarian for +15 additional movement(and Feat Athlete). 4 level to Rogue for Thief extra bonus action(and Feat Mobile). 2 level Fighter for Action Surge. So Monk2/Barbarian4/Rogue4/Fighter2. Ring of Absolute Force to make damage bigger. Use Callous Glow Ring make damage bigger. Haste Helm. Glove of Belligerent Sky. Boots of Speed, use Click Heels to double movement and make disadvantage on Opportunity Attacks to you. Cast Haste on self. Cast Longstrider on self. Now you have 1300 feet of movement or 130 jumps that do 1d4+3. Average damage of 5 x 130=650 AoE damage per turn.

OR the very best Hammerhaft build is skip the Monk all together and instead go Tempest Cleric11/Wizard1 and just cast Fly(or drink potion fly). Hammerhaft Thunder jump damage works with Fly oddly enough and you get the ridiculous movements and Wizard level is just for casting Longstriders and other buffs. Tempest Cleric can make even more damage with Destructive Wrath ability making each "jump" do the maximum damage. Thunderous Strike pushing enemies around. And then even if enemies manage a hit on you with Opportunity Attack you get Wrath of the Storm reaction for more damage.

Good times. Thanks for making the videos.

Edit* Also Cull the Weak is fun to add to either of these builds but I dont like to eat the worms.
