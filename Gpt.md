Create a fully detailed build guide from this transcript.
You must include Abilities, class creation, race selection, levels 1 to 12 build progress, items, skills, spells, abilities etc.
Be as detailed as you possibly can.
BE SURE to use the LATEST updates for information
Keep in mind the following update / change to the game: In "Baldur's Gate 3," the recent changes to the game have removed the specific ability score points traditionally tied to races. Instead, ability score points are now more closely associated with the class chosen by the player. This means that the race you choose no longer directly affects your character's ability scores. Each race, however, still retains its unique features, abilities, and sometimes, skill proficiencies, which are important for character development and gameplay.
They went for the tasha system of +2 +1 so you get to pick and chose for your build instead, but you still get the key traits of your race like lucky on gnomes

Write a DETAILED full guide, make sure its in copy-pastable markdown. Be as detailed as possible, and write EXACTLY what to chose, don't write things like "Race: Choose a race with charisma bonuses and relevant skill enhancements."

Gear, Items and their drop / purchase / obtaining location can be found in the attached xml sheet.

use the following format:
